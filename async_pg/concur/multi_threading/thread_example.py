#              10 RETURN_VALUE


# Here x is local to inc(). So no race condition happens. But if 
# x was global, there would be a race condition. 

# In the example below, the time.sleep() makes sure that the OS 
# swaps threads. 


# ==============================================
#
# import logging
# import threading
# import time
# import concurrent.futures


# class FakeDatabase:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.value = 0

#     def update(self, name):
#         logging.info("Thread %s: starting update", name)

#         # The local_copy is thread safe
#         # but the FakeDB.value that gets updated from it
#         # is shared between thread (without lock).
#         # So here the race condition happens: 
#         # The two threads have interleaving access to a 
#         # single shared object, overwriting each otherâ€™s results. 

#         # read the data from the DB
#         local_copy = self.value

#         # do something with it  
#         local_copy += 1   
#         time.sleep(0.1)
        
#         # write the result into DB
#         self.value = local_copy

#         logging.info("Thread %s: finishing update", name)


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     format = "%(asctime)s: %(message)s"
#     logging.basicConfig(format=format, level=logging.INFO,
#                         datefmt="%H:%M:%S")

#     database = FakeDatabase()
#     logging.info("Testing update. Starting value is %d.", database.value)

#     with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
#         for index in range(2):
#             executor.submit(database.update, index)

#     logging.info("Testing update. Ending value is %d.", database.value)




# When the thread starts running .update(), it has its own version 
# of all of the data local to the function. In the case of 
# .update(), this is local_copy. This is definitely a good thing. 
# Otherwise, two threads running the same function would always 
# confuse each other. 

# All variables that are scoped (or local) to a function are 
# thread-safe.

 # thread_pool.submit() has a signature that allows both 
 # positional and named arguments to be passed to the function 
 # running in the thread:
#        .submit(function, *args, **kwargs)

# Race conditions can occur when two or more threads access 
# a shared piece of data or resource.



# ==================================================
# 
# import logging
# import threading
# import time
# import concurrent.futures


# def thread_function(name):
#     logging.info("Thread %s: starting", name)
#     time.sleep(2)
#     logging.info("Thread %s: finishing", name)


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     format = "%(asctime)s: %(message)s"
#     logging.basicConfig(format=format, level=logging.INFO,
#                         datefmt="%H:%M:%S")

#     with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
#         executor.map(thread_function, range(3))


# The end of the with block causes the ThreadPoolExecutor to do 
# a .join() on each of the threads in the pool. It is strongly 
# recommended that you use ThreadPoolExecutor as a context manager 
# when you can so that you never forget to .join() the threads.

# Note: Using a ThreadPoolExecutor can cause some confusing errors.
# For example, if you call a function that takes no parameters, 
# but you pass it parameters in .map(), the thread will throw an 
# exception.
# Unfortunately, ThreadPoolExecutor will hide that exception, 
# and (in the case above) the program terminates with no output. 
# This can be quite confusing to debug at first.
